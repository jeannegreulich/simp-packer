Wed Mar 14 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 0.1.0-0
- simp-testing updates:
  - Added ability to set root's umask prior to running 'simp config'.
    This allows testing of the fix to the SIMP 6.1.0 problem in which
    SIMP failed to bootstrap on a system on which root's umask has
    already been restricted to 077.
  - Added tests to verify that the  puppetserver and puppetdb services
    are running after SIMP is bootstrapped.
  - Minor code refactor/documentation updates.
  - Checked in more example configurations.
