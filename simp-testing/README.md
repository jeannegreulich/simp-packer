### Overview

[Packer](https://packer.io) configuration to build a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box directly from a fresh [SIMP](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP) ISO and run some basic tests that need a full puppet install to verify.   SIMP 6 and later ISOs can be tested.

### Setup

Requirements:
  - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  - SIMP ISO created from build:auto and its json file.
    These contain the json variables that point to the iso,
    the iso checksum and the name of the distribution iso.
  - packer installed in or linked to /bin/packer. (There is
    another command called packer in /usr/sbin/packer so I
    point specifically to /bin/packer.)

### Usage
#### Simple build
1\. To define a test, create a test directory and include the following three files
 (There is more information on these three files in the samples directory.):
      vars.json:  The json file from the SIMP ISO.  If you have moved the iso
           make sure it points to the location of the SIMP ISO you want to test.
      simp_conf.yaml:  A simp_conf.yaml file with the setup you want to test.  These
         are generated by running simp config on a machine.  You can get a copy of
         one from a previous run or edit one from the samples files.
      packer.yaml:  You have to have this file but it will default everything.
         look in simp_config.rb for the default settings.

NOTE:  The puppet server info and fips info in the simp_conf.yaml file is all
changed by the defaults or the packer.yaml settings.

Assumptions at this time:
  - The puppet server will be set up to be X.X.X.7
  - DHCP and DNS are set up to contain server21.domain.name - server29.domain.name
    and ws30.domain.name - ws39.domain.name.
    The machine server21 will have IP X.X.X.21 and mac address of XXXXXXXXXX21
    and so on.
  - The default passwords for everything (users, LDAP) is P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd.
    You change it in vars.json with new_password.
  - Changing the LDAP Password doesn't work at this time.
  - It only works for systems with LDAP set up.  It will change
    the basedn to match what you have in packer.yaml for DOMAIN or use
    the default.  It sets up user1, user2, admin1, admin2.
  - The distribution DVD is looked for in the /net/ISO/Distribution_ISOs directory.
    It is hard coded in simp.json.template right now.


You don't have to set anything in the packer.yaml file on CentOS 7.  For CentOS 6
you need to change the NAT_INTERFACE and HOST_ONLY_INTERFACE to eth0 and eth1
respectively.


2\. Run the test: Run the script:
     TMPDIR=<some directory with lots of space> simp-packer_test.sh <full path to test directory from #1>

Packer use TMPDIR variable for it temporary directory and it needs something
like twice the space of the virtual machine so /tmp won't work.

It will run and create a working directory under the test directory where all the scripts,manifests and files are kept.
This is deleted at the end.  I did this so I could keep working and updating the files without having to worry about
messing with what was running.

A time stamped log file is created in the top level of the test directory and all the output from packer is copied here.
If the packer build fails, this is renamed from <date>.log to <date>.log.errors.

3\.  An overview of what it does
packer installs the iso, then packer uses the simp.json file to step it through
configuring simp according to the simp_conf.yaml and running simp bootstrap.
This is done in the build section and the start of the provisioning section.

Once the setup is complete, more tests are run.
it tests the following:
1) That the build of the puppet server is successful.
2) Puppet server is up and running and listening on the ports configured in simp_conf.yaml
3) It verifies that FIPS is setting match across the simp_conf.yaml, the simp_def.yaml and
   in the operational environment.
4) Checks that selinux is set to enforcing (the default for simp.)
5) If simp_crypt_disk is used in the simp.conf, it verifies that the disk is encrypted.
6) Verifies that /, /var/,/var/audit are separate partitions.
7) Checks that the port in puppet conf file matches the port in simp_conf.yaml


Default output directory is <test directory>/OUTPUT.

Once all the tests have run and passed, it will configure the simp server.
-sets up dns and kickstart server
-togen certificates for all the servers and clients
-adds users and groups into LDAP
-sets up autosign to be *.<domain name> so kickstarted systems will get
 their puppet cert autosigned.
-configures site.pp to use a hostgroup, workstations, for clients that start with ws*

- I have copied over some manifests like workstation.pp and nfs.pp but they have not
  been tested and are not configured at this time.


The output will be put in the output directory in a time stamped directory.
Packer fails if the output directory exists for some reason.

I put a Vagrant file in the output directory that can be used to bring up the vagrant box.
I couldn't put it in the time stamp directory because packer fails if the output directory
exists and I don't have the output directory in the shell script.  (TODO... fix that.)
I also didn't copy it into the vagrant box so you could see the settings in order to make sure you
have the correct network set up when you run it using vagrant.
The vagrant file does not configure the machine to use the ip address, I have that disabled.  You can turn it
on, but changing the IP Address will mess up the puppet server.  Also we set up the network using puppet
in simp config and we want to see what it does, not what vagrant does.

I also turned of the vagrant file sharing but that was just because it wasn't working at first.
I think that is fixed now.

-The vagrant password is vagrant.

### Virtual Box management notes:

This just gives some quick steps for checking your networks and configuring them

To list your hostonly networks:

   VBoxManage list hostonlyifs

When you create a new hostonly network it creates them in order, so vboxnet0, then vboxnet1 ...etc

To create a new network:
   VBoxManage hostonlyif create
(It will tell you what network it created.)

To update the address of the network:

   VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig <networkname>  --ip <network address>

So to make vboxnet1 set to 192.168.101.1 (that being the router address.)
   VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet1 --ip 192.168.101.1

### TODO
Tests to add:
- test if master is yum that yum is set up and working.
- check if puppet is actually running on the port you specified. (netstat or ss)
- add one last puppet run in at the end and check that it returns 0 (dns and all that should
  be set up and nothing chould change at that point.)
Features to add:
- add an Environment variable in to allow it to create the box even if tests fails.
- Kickstart a server and client to go with the box.
- The distribution iso is assumed to be in /net/ISO/Distribution__ISOs.  Make that configurable.
- validate input from packer.yaml and don't fail if it does not exist because you can run with
  all the defaults.
Clean it up:
- Move the Vagrant file into the Output directory.
- Change the packer.yaml settings to match the names used in the simp.json file to make
  things more consistent
- Merge the simp_config.rb and simp_packer_tests.sh into one ruby script and clean it up.
- Delete the Virtualbox Hostonly network if we created it???
