The test firectory should contain 3 files:

a simp_config.yaml file that is output from simp-cli.
This settings in the file will be over written from
the settings in the packer file, but not all the simp_config.yaml
file settings are changed.  It was to difficult to figure out all
the possibilities so we start with one output.

a vars.json file
  These are generated by the iso build.  It points to the location of the
iso, the checksum and the name of the distribution iso.
(The output directory and password from here are ignored at this time.)
At this time it looks for the distribution iso in
/net/ISO/Distribution_ISOs


a packer.yaml file
This file is a yaml file with over rides in it.  You can leave this blank
and it will work with a defaults.  (It has to exist at this time)

The defaults are set in simp_config.rb
The values are all strings.
These are the values you can set:

NOTE:  I don't do any real checking of variables at this time.

# The Name/description of the machine.  It is used to create files and
# directories so use only letters, numbers and -, _. 

VM_DESCRIPTION: 'SIMP6-CENTOS7-NOFIPS'
DOMAIN
# Fully path to the directory you want to place your output.
# The system will create a timestamp directory in here to place
# the data because it fails if the directory exists.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
# The machine has a nat interface that is used by vagrant.
# It must be the first interface
# On Centos 6 it should be eth0, on CentOS 7 enp0s3 works in most cases
NAT_INTERFACE: 'enp0s3'
# The machine will have a second interface that is host only at this time
# The hostonly GATEWAY and NETWORK should be already setup on your system before
# you run the test.  It will not create it for you.
# You need to use a class C network at this time.  I have the netwask hardcoded
# and I create the puppet ip by taking the first three octets and adding .7
# and the DHCP and DNS use the first three octet + 20 - 39 to create
# workstation and server ips
# The gateway is the router address
HOST_ONLY_GATEWAY: '192.168.101.1'
# The name of the virtualbox network
HOST_ONLY_NETWORK: 'vboxnet1'
# The interface used on the system for the hostonly network
# CentOS 6 it should be 'eth1', on CentOS 7 enp0s8 works in most cases
HOST_ONLY_INTERFACE: 'enp0s8'
# Wether to set up the system with fips
# Default it fips=0 which it turn fips on.
FIPS: 'fips=0'
# Host name of the server, will be appended to DOMAIN for full name.
PUPPETNAME' => 'puppet',
# This will be the password for the root, simp and LDAP root.
#  (new_password in the vars.json file is ignored.)
# This doesn't work sat this time (sorry)
NEW_PASSWORD: 'P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd',
# Set wether or not to encrypt the disk it is used at build time
# valid values
#   '' to not encrypt
#  'simp_crypt_disk' or 'simp_disk_crypt' to encrypt the disk
#  This is used in diskdetect script in the ks directory.
DISK_CRYPT:''
# The mac address of the host only interface.  (The nat interface mac
# is auto generated.) DHCP uses the first 10 numbers and adds 21 - 39 to create
# the mac addresses for the servers and workstations.
MACADDRESS: => 'aabbbbaa0007'
