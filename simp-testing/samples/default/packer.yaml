#This is an example yaml file for packer simp-testing
# The following variable must be set.
#  VM_DESCRIPTION is the name
VM_DESCRIPTION: 'SIMP6-CENTOS7-NOFIPS'
DOMAIN: release.me
# I couldn't figure out a good way to determine what the
# interface names should be so I  just set them at the begining
# NAT_INTERFACE is used by vagrant and packer to connect.
# By default Vagrant needs this to be the first interface.
# For CentOS 6.8 use eth0 for CentOS 7 use enp0s3.  These will
# work for the default vbox settings on the blades
NAT_INTERFACE: 'enp0s3'
# The next 4 settings are used to configure the interface used
# by the puppetserver and its clients.  I set up a class C HOST_ONLY network.
# I haven't tried a NatNetwork yet.
# For CentOS 6.X use eth1
HOST_ONLY_INTERFACE: 'enp0s8'
# The host only network must be configured manually.
# (We may do this on tastypuppet so everyone has a default set of networks
# that can be used by these systems.)
# The follwing were used in the sample tests:
#  vboxnetX = 192.168.10X.0 
# It is assumed that the the network is class C for dns and that the router is X.X.X.1 on the network.
HOST_VBOX_NETWORK_NAME: vboxnet1
HOST_ONLY_NETWORK: 192.168.101.0
# The mac address for the host only interface is set for DHCP.  
# Hopefully we will set it up to kickstart machines in the background
# And the mac address will need to be known by Virtualbox.
# 20 machines are set up using The Hostonly network and the
# first 10 chars in the mac.  server20-29 and ws30-39.  The number corresponds
# to last part of the IP and mac.
MACADDRESS: 'aabbccaa0007'

#The following can be set but have defaults set in simp_config.rb
# PUPPETIP  defaults to HOST_ONLY_NETWORK X.X.X.7
#
# DISK_CRYPT is used at boot to set wether the disk should be encrypted
# Valid values are "" or "simp_crypt"
DISK_CRYPT: ""
# Set FIPS to fips=0 or fip=1.  It will default to
# fips=0.  This used at boot and used to set the fips setting in the simp_config.yaml
# file.
FIPS: 'fips=0'
# Not sure this works yet.  I would leave it the default 'P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd'
